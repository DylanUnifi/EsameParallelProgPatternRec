# Lab of Parallel Computing for Machine Learnning

This project is written for the final exam in Parallel Computing. It involves searching a given time series within a larger set of time series using both sequential and parallel approaches. The parallel computing will be implemented using the OpenMP library in C++ and Joblib and asyncio for parallelization in Python.
